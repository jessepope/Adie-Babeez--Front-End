# Adie-Babeez 
Adie-Babeez was created as part of [Ada Developers Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/) Cohort 16 Capstone project. It's purpose is to connect student parents at Ada Developers Academy. Students can sign up for our site and access a social feed and direct messaging as means to connect with, and share resources between, student parents at Ada. We chose to build this app because we saw a need for additional support services for students in our cohort who were balancing parenting and/or care giving while also completing the program. We believe that connecting students who share similar experiences and needs would increase community support for these students. 

This app is integrated with a Flask API and React Chat Engine API. The user is able to create an account through Adie-Babeez and also be signed up for an account through Chat Engine, which enables direct messaging between users within the Adie-Babeez platform. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
